# Mystic NFC Tarot

A mobile-first, NFC-linked tarot reader built with Next.js 14, React, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion. Every tarot card receives its own URL so an NFC tag on the physical deck can summon a bespoke reading page. Users are greeted with the prompt “What mystery shall we solve today?”, enter their question, and receive a poetic yet grounded reading blending the card’s archetype with their inquiry.

## Features

- **Per-card portals** at `/cards/[slug]` ready for NFC deep links.
- **Immersive visuals** featuring animated starfields, constellation parallax, and theme switching (Indigo + Gold, Pastel Dawn, Monochrome Luxe).
- **Deterministic readings** generated by `/lib/generateReading.ts`, producing ≤500 character insights that name the card and reference the user’s topic.
- **Interaction suite** with anticipation delay, upright/reversed toggle, copy/share/download actions, and reflective journaling prompts.
- **Deck explorer** with search and filters for arcana and suit, paving the way to the full 78-card expansion.
- **Accessible by design** with high contrast, focus states, keyboard navigation, and respect for `prefers-reduced-motion`.

## NFC Tagging

1. Deploy the site (Vercel ready).
2. For each physical card, encode its NFC tag with the corresponding URL, e.g. `https://yourdomain.com/cards/the-fool`.
3. When tapped, the phone opens the matching card portal instantly.

## Extending the Deck

- Populate `data/cards.ts` with the remaining cards.
- Drop artwork into `public/images/cards/` and reference it via each card’s `image` field (Next.js `next/image` optimises delivery).
- Tailwind tokens and the theme switcher make it easy to add further palettes.

## Switching to an LLM

- The reading logic currently uses templated prose via `generateReading`.
- Implement `callLLM` in `lib/llm.ts` to integrate an API (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.).
- Update `ReadingExperience` to call `callLLM` instead of the template when desired.

## Performance Notes

- Images are SVG placeholders; swap in optimised art for production.
- Animations use Framer Motion and automatically respect reduced-motion preferences.
- Keep Lighthouse mobile ≥85 by lazy-loading heavy assets and pruning unused code as the project grows.
